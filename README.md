# Smart-Energy-and-Weather-Dashboard
A Python project exploring how weather patterns affect energy demand across cities. Built during my Python learning journey (guided by Python Crash Course â€“ Eric Matthes and other learning resources), it combines API integration, data simulation, and visualization to show the link between climate and energy use.
